## **Mutator**

    ➢➢➢ what is Mutator?

        sometimes we have to add some additional information with the user inputted data before inserting the data to the database. In this case, we have to use
        mutator to modify the user inputted data.

    ➢➢➢ how to make and use??

        1. Make a controller name MemberController

            command: php artisan make:controller MemberController

        2. Define a function inside the controller

            class MemberController extends Controller
            {
                function index(){
                    return "Hello from controller";
                }
            }

        3. Make a route for the controller

            At the top,
                use App\Http\Controllers\MemberController;

            At the bottom,
                Route::get('member', [MemberController::class, 'index']);

        4. Make a model name Member

            command: php artisan make:model Member

        5. Import the model to the controller

            use App\Models\Member;


        6. Modify the controller function to check the data are shown or not

            class MemberController extends Controller
            {
                function index(){
                    return Member::all();
                }
            }


        6. now write the code to insert data in the database in the controller function

            class MemberController extends Controller
            {
                function index(){
                    $member = new Member;
                    $member->name = "bruce";
                    $member->email = "bruce@gmail.com";
                    $member->address = "New York";
                    $member->save();
                }
            }

        7. Then, define mutator in the model

            class Member extends Model
            {
                public $timestamps = false;

                use HasFactory;

                public function setNameAttribute($value){
                    return $this->attributes['name'] = "Mr. ".$value;
                }

                public function setAddressAttribute($value){
                    return $this->attributes['address'] = $value.", USA";
                }
            }

        Note: Function name format is "setFieldNameAttribute()"

        8. We have to add this line for bypass the additional field requirement

            public $timestamps = false;
