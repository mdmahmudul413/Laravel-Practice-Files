## **Global Middleware**

    ➢➢➢ What is middleware??
    
        If we want to add some set of rules or some conditions in our website page then we have to use middlewares. 

        In this way, we just write down codes in a single place then use in different places whenever we want to use.

    ➢➢➢ There are three types of middlewares. they are,

        1. Global Middleware
        2. Grouped Middleware
        3. Routed Middleware

    ➢➢➢ How to use middleware?

    1. Make multiple views like

        user.blade.php, noaccess.blade.php

    2. Make a middleware

        command: php artisan make:middleware checkAge

    3. Write the conditions or checks or set of rules in the app/http/middleware/checkAge.php like bellow

    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
        {
            echo "Global message is printed in every page";
            if($request->age && $request->age<18){
                return redirect('noaccess');
            }
            if($request->age && $request->age>17){
                return redirect('user');
            }
            return $next($request);
        }

    4. Then, create route in the web.php

        Route::view('user', 'user');
        Route::view('noaccess', 'noaccess');

    5. Then go to app/http/kernel.php

        There are three arays. global, group, routed. for now, we use global array and add the middleware like bellow
        \App\Http\Middleware\checkAge::class

    6. Now write url like bellow

        localhost?age=15 , it will redirect the view noaccess.blade.php
        localhost?age=30 , it will redirect the view user.blade.php

    7. It's a global middleware, so that the set of rules will apply in every pages
