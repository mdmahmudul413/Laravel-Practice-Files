## **Model**

    ➢➢➢ Connect database through model

    ➢➢➢ What is model?
    
        Model maps database tables with class name, define database structure, write business login

        Note: If the table name is users then we have to make model name user. it means table name should be plural and model name should be singular.

    ➢➢➢ How to make model and use??

        1. make a model

            command: php artisan make:model User

        2. To use this model, we have to make controller

            command: php artisan make:controller UserController

        3. Import model to controller

            add this line of code at the top, use App\Models\User;

    4. Make a function to fetch data in the controller

        class UserController extends Controller
        {
            function getData(){
                return User::all();
            } 
        }

    5. Make a route of this controller

        Add this at the top,
            
            use App\Http\Controllers\UserController;

        Add this at the top bottom,
            
            Route::get('users', [UserController::class, 'getData']);


    6. go to .env file to add db info 

    7. then browse localhost/users

    8. if there is another table to show name employee

        Go to the model(app/model/user.php) and add this line

            class User extends Authenticatable
            {
                use HasApiTokens, HasFactory, Notifiable;

                <!-- add bellow line only -->
                public $table = "employee";

                ...
            }

        Then, browse localhost/users
